The main file is 'NCAAB2025', and the regression output in the first chunk populates the first sheet of the excel file, which should be updated as soon as new games are put in.
Credits to Erik Haslam (https://haslametrics.com/), Ken Pomeroy (https://kenpom.com/), and the team at RealGM (https://basketball.realgm.com/) for their data that supports my analysis. 

This is the earliest stage of this project so the code is pretty humble. I've mainly been using R for the regression output up until this point, so I don't expect this code to wow anyone. The main spreadsheet is far more robust, but I will be putting in some work after March Madness to build this out when I have free time.

There are also lots of resources and fun little tools in there as well. The code will constantly be expanding and growing in complexity, this project will be built upon more over the next several years.
